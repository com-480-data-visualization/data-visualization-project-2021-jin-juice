# Milestone 2


## Interaction of Trump and Parler


### Echo Chamber

We aim at comparing Trump’s behavior and the behavior of his supporters on Parler. We want to visualize the echo chambers of Trump's community, but also the impact of his supporters on his campaign strategy (wording choices echoing Parler discussions etc). For example, we would like to see how the use of certain hashtags based on Trump's statements exploded on Parler after he said them. The figure above illustrates the usage trend of the famous #stopthesteal phrase after the 7th september when Jack Posobiec tweeted “#StopTheSteal 2020 is coming…”. Hence, overall we will visualize histograms of the most frequenty used hashtags/words, as well as how their frequency evolves over time. This section would regroup several visualizations e.g word clouds, graphs showing word/hashtags frquencies, time series, etc.


### Sentiment Analysis

Another one of our goals is to visualize the sentiments of the Parler posts/comments and how they evolve through time as certain political events occur i.e tweets/statements by influential political figures, Capitol Raid etc. We intend to do this as an interactive time series line graph of the sentiments' proportions per day as shown in the figure above and illustrate how the negative sentiment dominates after the Capitol Raid, although the posts were mostly positive befire that. We might also include an alterantive visualzation of the generall overall sentiment scores (between -1 and 1), as opposed to visualizing each sentiment independently.
